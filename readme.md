The ZombiU Mod Loader is a program that allows you to run your own code inside of Ubisoft's Survival Horror game ZombiU. This allows you to create custom mechanics, rebalance weapons, give items to the player and so much more. This is possible through a process called DLL injection, which is when you insert your own code into the game while it's running. This means that I don't have to package any of Ubisoft's code in order to ship it. <b>Only offically purchased copies from steam are supported, I do not support pirated copies of the game.</b>

# Installation

To install the mod loader, follow the steps below and run it from Steam.
> 1. Open the Zombi game directory
> 2. Rename the Zombi.exe to ZOMBIORG.exe
> 3. Extract the zip contents into the game directory.
> 4. Run it from Steam or double click the new Zombi.exe

A more detailed tutorial will be written in the wiki section for those who are less familiar with poking around game files.

If you have any problems, please post them in the issues section with the loader version number (found in the bottom left of the game window) and I will try to address them.

I have published a mod to demonstrate the features of the mod loader called [ZombiU-Reimagined](https://github.com/Darkstar6423/ZombiU-Reimagined).
